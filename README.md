# RunningGuys-BGE

The open-source version of **Running Guys**, from the ancient times when the **Blender Game Engine** was still alive and kicking.
A retro-style pixelated platformer, with a vibe close to classic 8-bit games.
Preserved here for curiosity, nostalgia, and maybe inspiration.

Built with the **Blender Game Engine** (yes, that was a thing).

Expect some rough edges, but also a snapshot of indie gamedev history.

Feel free to fork, tinker, and run around with it!

# FAQ

## What Blender version should I use?
Anything between **Blender 2.5** and **Blender 2.79** should work fine (thatâ€™s the era when the Blender Game Engine was still alive). If you want better compatibility with modern systems, you can also try forks like **UPBGE** or **Range Engine**.

## Why a 2D game on Blender?
Just for the fun of it ;) It was more of a challenge-type project, experimenting with what was possible in the Blender Game Engine, and aiming for a retro pixelated vibe.

## What is UPBGE / Range Engine, and should I use them?
**UPBGE** is a fork of Blender that keeps the Blender Game Engine alive, with bug fixes, improvements, and modern features.

**Range Engine** is a continuation in the same spirit, aiming for better stability and compatibility with recent Blender versions.

If you want to tinker with the project on modern hardware, these are probably your best options.

## What are the system / hardware requirements?
Since itâ€™s a small retro-style game, the requirements are modest. However:

For older BGE versions, almost any decent machine with OpenGL support should run it.

For UPBGE / Range Engine (more modern builds), youâ€™ll want something closer to Blenderâ€™s current requirements: ~quad-core CPU, 6GB RAM, GPU with 2GB VRAM, and OpenGL 4.3+.

## Can I modify or upgrade the graphics / assets?
**Yes!** The project is **open source**, so youâ€™re free to fork it and experiment. Keep in mind:
- Changing resolution, sprites, or animations may require adjusting collisions and level layouts.
- Modern forks like UPBGE can support shaders and filters, but visuals may differ between systems.
- The original charm lies in its quasi 8-bit pixelated look, so upgrades should balance nostalgia with improvements.

## Where can I find the improved version of the game?
The modern, polished version of Running Guys is available on Steam: [Running Guys on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2333430/Running_Guys/)
